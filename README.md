Journey Journal

Journey Journal will be made using the MERN stack.This is an application that allows users to track their emotions daily. We will accomplish this by using either a built in react calendar or use a react compatible calendar called fullcalendar.io. Users will be able to add “emotions” the same way “events” can be added to a calendar. CRUD will be implemented by allowing users to Create a “journal entry”. The data will be stored in a mongoDB database and can be Read from there. Users can then Update their entries if needed, or if it's easier, they can Delete the entry all together. A lot of our project will be focused around styling and making the application fun to look at. Our inspiration is based off of a “Bullet Journal”- which is why the wireframe looks like a journal. Dada validation will be when the user goes to create an entry, they cannot submit it without at least selecting an emotion.
